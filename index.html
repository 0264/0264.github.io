eclipsed as a life form. MON 21 AUGUST 2017. A celestial event today humbled me. Each of us is born with curiousity of the super natural and the after life, elements and ideas beyond the known realm. A giant fire ball in our sky reaches outside our sphere of influence and exists in our reality as an immense observable object which seems supremely super natural. Imagine, if you stare at that object with your eyes not shielded and not protected from photic/solar retinopathy, then the punishment for directly examining the giver of all life and energy on Earth is that your eye sight is severely damaged or eliminated. I liked looking down at my feet where trees cast shadows containing hundreds of crescent shaped suns on the ground. A little boy learning to bicycle with training wheels and his grand mother offered solar filter glasses.
